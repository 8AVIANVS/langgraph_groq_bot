# LangGraph Chatbot with Groq

This project implements a simple chatbot following the [official LangGraph guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph), but uses Groq's LLM instead of the default model.

The implementation demonstrates:
- Basic LangGraph state management
- Integration with Groq's language model
- Simple chatbot conversation flow

## Requirements
- Python
- `langchain-groq`
- `langgraph`
- `langsmith` (for tracing)
