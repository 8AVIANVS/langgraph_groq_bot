# LangGraph Chatbot with Groq

This project builds on the [official LangGraph guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph) to make a chatbot. It uses Groq's service instead of default models directly. In addition, the chatbot retains session memory.

## Requirements
- Python
- `langchain-groq`
- `langgraph`
- `langsmith` (for tracing)
